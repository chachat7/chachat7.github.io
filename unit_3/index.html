	<p>" I was born a thrift shopper's daughter" Growing up my idea of fun was antique/thrift shopping with the family. I never grew out the urge to find odd, interesting, collective and beautiful pieces. our mission is to share our creative eye with others, and letting people give these treasures a second or third home.</p>
